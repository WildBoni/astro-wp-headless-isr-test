<p>As many folks like to give gifts to one another during the last month or two of the year, we&#8217;d be remiss if we didn&#8217;t try to take some of the mental load from your shoulders. What follows is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/techcrunchplus">TechCrunch+ gift guide for 2023</a>, just for you, you lovely human:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A monthly TechCrunch+ subscription!</strong> Yes, if you currently do not have access to TechCrunch+ and are a bit light on funds, we recommend buying TechCrunch+ for yourself, but at our monthly rate, as it is less expensive up front. For those of you with a bit more spare cash, however:</li>
<li><strong>A yearly TechCrunch+ subscription!</strong> This is a great gift for your mind and for your wallet! But we have one more idea:</li>
<li><strong>A student subscription to TechCrunch+!</strong> Way back when I was a wee lad I went to a TechCrunch event on a student ticket. It cost something like $100 or thereabouts, and I was stoked to attend what was then called the TechCrunch 50 in person. I still recall the awe I felt being in <em>the</em> building. Anyway, all that&#8217;s to say that student passes whip ass, and we have one of them ready for the student in your life. Buy three! (Verification required.

</ol>
<p>And if you are someone who already <em>has</em> a TechCrunch+ subscription, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/ec-gifting/"><strong>you can buy one </strong></a>for your friend, loved one, mortal enemy, prodigal child or parent!</p>
<p>Such great options for the holiday period! But wait, there&#8217;s more! We&#8217;re also running the TechCrunch+ holiday sale <em>right now!</em> So stock up on TechCrunch+; it&#8217;s fun for the whole family!</p>
