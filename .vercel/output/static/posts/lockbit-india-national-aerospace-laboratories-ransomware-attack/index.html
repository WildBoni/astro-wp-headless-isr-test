<p>On Wednesday, LockBit added the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) to its dark web leak site, which ransomware gangs use to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/31/ransomware-victims-paying-hackers-ransom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extort victims for ransom payments</a>. The group threatened to publish the organization&#8217;s stolen data if it fails to pay an unspecified ransom, according to the listing seen by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>LockBit posted eight purportedly stolen documents, including confidential letters, an employee&#8217;s passport and other internal documents.</p>
<p>At the time of publication NAL&#8217;s website was down across the world. It is unclear if the website outage was due to the claimed ransomware attack.</p>
<p>NAL and India&#8217;s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Set up in 1959, the NAL is India&#8217;s first and largest aerospace research organization. It is owned by the Indian Government&#8217;s Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, led by the prime minister, and works closely with other government entities, including the Indian Space Research Organisation and Defence Research and Development Organisation.</p>
<p>For the past few months, LockBit has hacked some of the world&#8217;s most renowned companies. Some of its most recent victims include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/30/tsmc-confirms-data-breach-after-lockbit-cyberattack-on-third-party-supplier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/07/lockbit-ransomware-royal-mail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British postal service and courier company Royal Mail</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/15/lockbit-ransomware-granules-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pharma giant Granules India</a>. It also targeted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/03/hackers-claims-ransomware-attack-on-los-angeles-housing-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angelesâ€™ housing authority</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/california-finance-department-lockbit-ransomware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California&#8217;s finance department</a> in recent years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
